</details>

<details>
  <summary>Emergency Delivery</summary>
  <p>1. Have towels or blankets ready to dry & warm the baby.
     Make sure the mother is lying down or propped up to prevent injury from a fall.
    Also, wash your hands thoroughly before touching the mother or baby. </p>

  <p>2. When the head appears, support the perineum (the area between the vagina and anus) with a hand while gently guiding the baby's head. </p>
  
  <p>3.Once the head is out, check if the umbilical cord is around the baby's neck. If it is, 
    gently try to unloop it or loosen it enough for the body to slip through. </p>
  
  <p>4. With the next contraction, the shoulders should emerge. You may need to apply gentle downward traction for the anterior shoulder and guide the body upward to deliver the posterior shoulder. </p>

  <p>5. Do not pull/cut on the umbilical cord at this stage. </p>

  <p>6. Dry the baby with a clean, warm towel and stimulate them to help them breathe. Place the baby on the mother's chest. </p>

  <p>7. Stay with the mother until the placenta delivers, which may take a few minutes. Do not pull on the cord. </p>
